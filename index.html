        <h2> Welcome! </h2>
        <p> Whether you're an avid reader or you've never picked up a book in your life, you've come to the right place. Here, you'll be able to explore options for recreational reading. I won't be reviewing informational books, and I will only briefly cover non-fiction. However, there will be a lot of discussion on fictional genres. Also, the primary target audience for these books will be young adults, but anyone can read and enjoy them. Have fun! </p>

      <p> Hi! My name is Shruti Balla, and I am going to 9th grade in the fall. This is almost my third year doing web design, and I love it! I enjoy coding (obviously), reading (obviously), and running. My favorite school subject is currently social studies, but that usually changes every year. I'm doing Coursera because I hope to expand my knowledge of web design, and prepare myself for AP computer courses in the school year. Enjoy the website! </p>
